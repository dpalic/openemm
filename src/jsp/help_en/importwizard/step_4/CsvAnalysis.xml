All columns to be imported are displayed. Some information in the
csv-file is transformed by OpenEMM automatically: “m”/”Herr”
for german gender “male” or “w”/”Frau” for german gender
female is automatically transformed in “0” for male and “1”
for female and “2” or unknown gender.</P>

symbols to the right of the preview, you can browse the data by
scrolling to the next page. Please note that this is a preview only. Data may not be changed in
this view.  If you find errors in the preview, you must change the
original file and create a new csv file for import. </SPAN>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><B>Please note:</B>
Before importing data, you should check every single recipient
profile. Experience shows that skimming the first few entries is
simply not enough.  Many import files contain faulty data which will
cause problems after importing them into the database.  Once you have
saved faulty data in the E-Marketing Manager database, it is far more
difficult and time-consuming to detect errors and to correct them. 
Large import files also have a large conflict potential. </SPAN>
