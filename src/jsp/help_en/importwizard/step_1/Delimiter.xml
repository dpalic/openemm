	<title>Text recognition character</title>
	<content><![CDATA[In case your recipient data contain the separator specified, it must
be identified by a different character. If the separator, for
instance, is a comma, and if recipient data also contain commas, the
commas used as separators must be identified separately before
import.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Let us take an
example. Suppose the csv file contains <FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif">Towns</FONT>
which are only differentiated by a region name, like <FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif">Neustadt;
Weinstra&szlig;e</FONT> or <FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif">Neustadt;
Aisch</FONT>. If your spreadsheet software is Microsoft Excel, saving
data as a csv file will cause semicolons to be inserted as
separators. In order to differentiate the separators from the
semicolons contained in the text, Excel automatically inserts
quotation marks (&quot;) as a text recognition character when saving
data as a csv file.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Therefore, if you
use Excel as your import source software, we recommend selecting
quotation marks as text recognition character. This causes the
semicolons to be contained in the town names to not be used as
database separators: Neustadt &quot;;&quot;<B> </B>Weinstra&szlig;e,
Neustadt &quot;;&quot; Aisch.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><B>Please note:</B>
This example describes a csv file created by Microsoft Excel. If you
use a different spreadsheet software, we recommend checking your
software manual to find out which separators your program uses.]]></content>
