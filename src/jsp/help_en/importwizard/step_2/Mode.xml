used to control how the E-Marketing Manager integrates imported data
into the database. The following modes are available:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Add only new
	recipients</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Add new recipients

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This gives you a great
deal of scope for updating your profile database. Sometimes you will
receive e-mails from subscribers requesting to be sent a newsletter
instead of registering for a mailing list on your website. To enter
just one recipient is not a great deal of trouble. As soon as dozens
of such mails need processing, it is easier to produce a spreadsheet
with user details and import them into the E-Marketing Manager.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">You can update the
recipient status for subscribers who wish to unsubscribe, but cannot
or do not want to do so themselves, in the same way. The options Mark
recipients as </SPAN><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Opt-Out</SPAN></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
and Mark recipients as </SPAN><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Bounced</SPAN></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
are used for this purpose. This procedure is mainly offered for legal
reasons, since some recipients threaten legal action if their request
to unsubscribe is not heeded.</SPAN></P>]]></content>
