Please note:
Below you will find IMPORTANT INFORMATION for users who used the ONLINE UPDATE
feature of OpenEMM to upgrade to this version of OpenEMM. You can reread this
text in file UPDATE.txt at any time.


OPENEMM CMS DATABASE (if you upgrade from OpenEMM < 6.0)
====================
If your MySQL user root uses a password, the online update of OpenEMM could not
set up the new CMS database. In this case the online update ended with error
message "Failed to postprocess" and the update of OpenEMM is incomplete.

But this is not a problem, because you can set up the CMS database manually
from the command line with

$> mysqladmin -u root -p create openemm_cms
$> mysql -u root -p openemm_cms < /home/openemm/USR_SHARE/openemm_cms.sql


CONFIGURATION FILES
===================
To make sure your configurations files are set up correctly, go to directory
/home/openemm/webapps/core/WEB-INF/classes and compare the parameters in files
emm.properties and cms.properties (which were auto-generated by the online
update) with the original files emm.properties-orig and cms.properties-orig in
the same directory to make sure all your individual settings have been copied
successfully.

What you have to do manually is to set parameter mailgun.ini.mailer near the
end of file emm.properties:

mailgun.ini.mailer=OpenEMM V6.2

This makes sure that the online update knows which version is the current one.

If you use the CMS module of OpenEMM to build mailings and want to change the
default text for text mails, please change the content of field 'text' in
table 'cm_text_version_tbl' of database 'openemm-cms' accordingly. At least
you should change the domain name of the links from 'localhost' to your
redirect domain name.


(RE)STARTING OPENEMM
====================
When you are finished you have to (re)start OpenEMM with
$> su - openemm
$> OpenEMM.sh stop; OpenEMM.sh start
$> exit


OPENEMM CMS DEMO DATABASE
=========================
To make it easier for you to check out the new Content Manager of OpenEMM file
openemm_demo-cms.sql contains a CMS demo database. You will find this file in
the same directory as file openemm_cms.sql with the empty default CMS database.

If you want to use the CMS demo database instead of the default CMS database
simply replace the name of file openemm_cms.sql in line 17 above with file
name openemm_demo-cms.sql.

If you already created mailings based on CM templates you should delete these
mailings first because the CMS demo database will overwrite your existing CMS
database and the references from CM template-based mailings would link to
content modules which no longer exist. In this case drop the old CMS database
first with

$> mysqladmin -u root -p drop openemm_cms
