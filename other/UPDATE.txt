Please note:
Below you will find IMPORTANT INFORMATION for users who used the ONLINE UPDATE
feature of OpenEMM to upgrade to version 6.0 of OpenEMM. You can reread this
text in file UPDATE.txt at any time.


OPENEMM CMS DATABASE
====================
If your MySQL user root uses a password, the online update of OpenEMM could not
set up the new CMS database. In this case the online update ended with error
message "Failed to postprocess" and the update of OpenEMM 6.0 is incomplete.

But this is not a problem, because you can set up the CMS database manually
from the command line with

$> mysqladmin -u root -p create openemm_cms
$> mysql -u root -p openemm_cms < /usr/share/doc/OpenEMM-6.0/openemm_cms.sql


CONFIGURATION FILES
===================
Even if the online update succeeded without warning or error message you are
not done yet, because new versions of configuration files emm.properties and
cms.properties were installed in directory
/home/openemm/webapps/core/WEB-INF/classes.

These files contain some generic settings, but you probably modified your
"old" properties before. Therefore, to finish the update of OpenEMM 
correctly, you have to edit both files and copy your changes:

1. emm.properties
You will find your old emm.properties in backup directory
/home/openemm-x.y/webapps/core/WEB-INF/classes.
Please copy the modifications you made to the new emm.properties file
like database connection settings, system.url, recipient.maxRows and
import.maxRows (especially system.url is important!). If a property
exists in the old emm.properties but not in the new file, you can
safely ignore it.

2. cms.properties
This is easier: Simply modify property cms.ccr.url (usually the same
URL as system.url, please see Install Guide for details).


(RE)STARTING OPENEMM
====================
When you are finished you have to (re)start OpenEMM with
$> su - openemm
$> OpenEMM.sh stop; OpenEMM.sh start
$> exit 


OPENEMM CMS DEMO DATABASE
=========================
To make it easier for you to check out the new Content Manager of OpenEMM file
openemm_demo-cms.sql contains a CMS demo database. You will find this file in
the same directory as file openemm_cms.sql with the empty default CMS database.

If you want to use the CMS demo database instead of the default CMS database
simply replace the name of file openemm_cms.sql in the command line above with
file name openemm_demo-cms.sql.

If you already created mailings based on CM templates you should delete these
mailings first because the CMS demo database will overwrite your existing CMS
database and the references from CM template-based mailings would link to
content modules which no longer exist. In this case drop the old CMS database
first with

$> mysqladmin -u root -p drop openemm_cms
